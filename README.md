# Email List Churn Rate Prediction

## Introduction
This R code is an example of Email List Churn Prediction utilizing **Random Forest** ML technique.

We attempt to classify the email subscribers in those who will churn and those who won't, based on data collected from email
campaigns launched through [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

You can find the whole analysis here: [How to Predict Churn: When Do Email Recipients Unsubscribe?](https://blog.blendo.co/predicting-churn-email-unsubscribe/) 

## Usage
I have used R version 3.3.3 (2017-03-06) -- "Another Canoe"

All packages needed are mentioned in the code.

You just need to import the data as a .csv file, 
install the required packages and run the code!
